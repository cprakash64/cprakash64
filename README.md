## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chandra Prakash Pandey!

ðŸ”¹ Passionate Problem Solver | Developer | Tech Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a passionate Computer Science student driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving. From full-stack web development to the depths of machine learning, I thrive on building, learning, and exploring new tech. My journey spans hands-on experience in technologies like Python, Java, React, C, Node.js, and .NET Core, and Iâ€™m especially excited about tackling challenges in cybersecurity, Web3, and AI. Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of projects that reflect my dedication to crafting impactful, innovative solutions.

ðŸŒ± Currently:
- Building Luna AI, an advanced video analysis AI that reduces hours of work to minutes.
- Working on a media search engine capstone project to enhance content discovery and analytics.
- Learning more about binary exploitation and network security through hands-on challenges.

ðŸš€ Goals & Projects:
- Iâ€™m always exploring new project ideas in AI, Web3, and full-stack development.
- Iâ€™m working on a hackathon project, Data Guardian â€“ a decentralized AI-powered privacy protector for the web.

Iâ€™m always open to collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of tech, especially in fields like AI, Web3, and software engineering. Feel free to reach out if you're looking for a collaborator whoâ€™s ready to dive deep into innovation.

âš¡ Fun Fact:
Iâ€™m more of an adventurous guy! I've even taken the leap with skydiving and love to travel and explore the world whenever I can. If Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably out admiring the beauty of nature and discovering new places.
